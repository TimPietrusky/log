## Fritzing

If you want to use the NeoPixel in Fritzing:

```
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library
```

In Fritzing choose "File / Open" and open the "AdaFruit.fzbz" that is part of the repository you just cloned. 

When this is done you should save Adafruit bin into Fritzing in order to use it again and again. This can be done by using the menu in the pallete window and hit "save bin".
