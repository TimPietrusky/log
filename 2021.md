## 2020 recap

*2020-01-27*

I can't believe that [2020](2020.md) was what it was when I started to write the things I want to accomplish. As it turned out, the title *"Get my shit together"* (<cite>[2020](2020.md)</cite>) was very accurate, even more than I would have imagined. Who am I kidding, it was fucking beyond my own universe. But let's see the results of my [2020 goals](2020.md#goals-in-2020):

### Understand me

In December 2020 I had the first interaction with a Psychologist, which was a huge step for me. I'm waiting for the first "get to know each other" session, but my hopes are low to actually get a therapy based on this, as the waiting list is very long. But as I started, will continue.

### Improve health

* A few months in 2020 of not eating meat, but then I started again to eat meat regularly. Most of the time I ate local meat from a butcher in a very high quality, but I also had times where I ate fast-food-quality meat. This will change this year for sure
* I reduced the consumption of alcohol to a super minimum, this can be even more improved
* Until July I was still smoking weed regularly, but I stopped since 02. July 2020
* I still ate a lot of white sugar, mostly sweets. This is something I'm in the process of stopping since 23rd of January 2021
* I smoked almost no tobacco, but the few times I did where not worth it at all. I just need to stop doing this 100%
* I did two yoga positions almost every day, but I never got really into it to get "further". My lower back is still not 100% pain free
* Meditation was something I didn't integrate at all. I'm actually not sure why, I guess I'm just too lazy
* I tried to use some memory techniques to exercise my brain, but didn't start to walk this path
* I slept a lot more, even when there were a lot of nights without a good quality of sleep, but those were related to my daughter sleeping next to me and she was not sleeping very well until late of 2020. Then I tried CBD to calm her down at night and this was improving my sleep drastically as she is sleeping super well


### Family vacation

We were not really able to do any family vacation. First reason is that FaPi and I are not in a romantic relationship anymore, which shifted our focus a lot. And the other reason was Covid-19, which forced us to cancel all vacation plans. We spend a lot of time together in the house and in our garden, but it was no vacation where we actually where at a different place. But that was not a bad thing at all. 


### Get in contact with my family

I couldn't manage this at all. I want to try this again this year. Get in contact with my aunt and grandmother. More contact with my parents. Any kind of contact with my brother. 


### Writing habit

The only thing I wrote was the list of goals for 2020, nothing more. This will stop with this new format. 


### Sell 10 Konekti subscriptions

We were not ableo to sell 10 Konekti subscriptions, but we were able to set the right direction for Synoa and for our product Konekti. I stronlgy believe that 2021 will be our year.


### Read 1 x book

Instead of finishing the book "Neuromancer by William Gibson" in time (I didn't even finish 1/3 of the book), I spend most my vacation to play the game "Cyberpunk 2077". The book is awesome, I just didn't invest time to actually finish it. Instead I was playing a lot of "Heros of the Storm" on my computer, even after I stopped smoking weed. This will also change this year. I want to finish the book. 


### Write 1 x song

I wasn't able to create a song in 2020, I only started to look into [rust-loop-drop](https://github.com/mmckegg/rust-loop-drop) almost exactly 1 year after I wrote "[How to get started?](https://github.com/mmckegg/rust-loop-drop/issues/2)". But this year I will create at least one song that I enjoy, it might not be with [rust-loop-drop](https://github.com/mmckegg/rust-loop-drop). 


### Explore Machine Learning

I attended one workshop at [CODAME "Make Art with Machine Learning"](https://codame.com/events/make-art-with-machine-learning) in which I learned some basics on the topic, but I didn't dive deeper. I also bought the book "Practical Machine Learning in JavasSript" and I want to read it this year to get more into the topic. 


### First steps with a robot

Didn't use my robots, will use them once my children are more chill with things. I guess then this will be super fun. 


### Use modV 3.0

In December 2020 I was able to finally switch to modV 3.0 (every other gig in 2020 was still using modV 2.0). But this was last minute, as only the very last gig (the New Years Eve Party together with 2xAA) was using modV 3.0. But I made it and I'm very happy. 

Sam Wray and myself also made it a habbit to have a fixed modV pair-programming session every tuesday evening, to further improve and build modV. My dedication for modV is more strong than ever and I want to invest a lot of time to make it as perfect as it can be. 


### Become a better VJ

* I did a few sessions with Jan Krutisch via YouTube and this was always super fun as we had a different topic each time. This was forcing me to take a look at new visuals with each gig and improve my modV set all the time. Having a regular session was also improving my connection to Jan's music and I have now a pretty good idea on how he is playing and what I need to do in order to make it look good from a visual point of view. I'm very happy about this
* In the first months of 2020 we had some gigs together with [schickmalzwo](https://schickmalzwo.de/) and a lot of gigs planned for [LiveJS](https://livejs.network/), but due to Covid-19 everything was cancelled. All the other gigs I had were some kind of live streams and one secret festival in the summer (where I did visuals and lights) + secret birthday bash
* I did a few workshops related to shader programming and because of the collaboration with Jan Krutisch, Sam Wray, Stone Creek Crew & Banana Bass Music I forced my self to create new content based on shaders from Lea Rosema and stuff from Shadertoy. By the end of 2020 I had a very good understanding on how the GLSL code works and which parts I need to change to make it parameterized to be used in modV 
* I also started to create a [few shaders myself](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/TimPietrusky) (most of them are private :D)

### Run the "Visual and Light Workshop" at least 2 times

Thanks to Covid-19 all our plans to do the workshop in combination with gigs with LiveJS were doomed. The last possibility Sam Wray and myself had was to do a workshop for CODAME's JOYNT Festival 2020. We had the honor to be selected for the festival and created a [workshop dedicated to modV 3](https://github.com/vcync/modV-Workshop). The workshop was super cool, about 15 people came. We had a major problem during the workshop (some users were not able to use audio-routing inside of modV because of permission problems in macOS). We were not able to fix this during the workshop, but the next day we found the problem (permissions in Electron). But overall the workshop was super nice and we loved doing it.

So yeah that's it for the recap, I'm not sure if I should create a list of goals for this year? But let's see what my next log entry will bring...
